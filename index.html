<h1>Zen Garden Assignment</h1>
    <h2>Why is Zen Garden Interesting?</h2>
    <p>
        Zen Garden is an interesting webpage because it allows for contributors to create widely varying CSS files that control the same HTML file. This capability helps to further the site’s mission of proving how useful and powerful CSS can be in controlling webpages. By allowing for user submissions, Zen Garden is also creating a great learning opportunity.

    <h2>Screen Filler</h2>
    <p>
    My favorite CSS design on the Zen Garden page was the page titles “Screen Filler.” I chose to examine this page because the concept fell in line with one of the main things that I picked up on in the reading. The page adapts spectacularly to shrinking and expanding the size of the window. After completing the reading, I was thinking about the fact that controlling the size of elements has several approaches: pixels, percentages, and ems.

    <p>
    Up until this reading and looking at Zen Garden, I thought that it would be best to control sizes in pixels because it would be the easiest to manage. However, this creates problems with varying screen sizes, especially phone screens. For this reason, I think it might be better to control the size in percentages, so that everything could shrink is proportion to each other. There are more elements that go into making screen size changes work well, but sizes controlled by percentages seem to be one of the first steps.

    It is clear that percentages were used in the CSS designs upon using the inspector element, as well as minimum widths and floating blocks. These elements were covered in our readings, but it is really helpful to see the potential that they have to actually create an aesthetically pleasing and user friendly webpage.
